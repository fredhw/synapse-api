# Synapse API
This repo was created based on a server-side development course project. 

Supports multiple EEG data operations exposed as a simple HTTP API, with additional optional features such as API token authorization, HTTP traffic throttle strategy and CORS support for web clients.

* Plumber Documentation - https://www.rplumber.io/docs/routing-and-input.html#endpoints
* EEG Analysis Script - https://github.com/uwccdl/qeeg

To get started, take a look the installation steps and API docs.

## Installation

### Docker

See [Dockerfile](https://github.com/fredhw/synapse-api/blob/master/servers/qeeg-api/Dockerfile) for image details.


## Clients

- [sarahp39/SynapseSystems](https://github.com/sarahp39/SynapseSystems)

## HTTP API

### Authorization

synapse-api supports a simple token-based API authorization.

### Params

Complete list of currently available params. Take a look to each specific endpoint to see which params are supported

- **subject**     `string`      - name of the subject. This will be combined into a single filename along with session.
- **session**     `string`      - name of the session. This will be combined into a single filename along with subject.
- **ch**          `string`      - the specified channel
- **sampling**    `int`         - the sampling rate. Default: 128 Hz.
- **window**      `int`         - the duration (in seconds) of each segment (epoch) used as the bases of the FFT analysis. Default: 2 seconds.
- **sliding**     `float`       - the proportion of each segment that does not overlap with the previous segment. In other words, the proportion of overlap between adjacent segments is (1 - sliding). It needs to be a number between 0 and 1 (not a percentage!). Default: 0.75.

#### POST /v1/upload
Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`

Uploads a selected file into the `raw-data` folder on the server. Files are parsed with `r.FormFile("file")` in Golang.

#### GET /v1/sumfile
Content-Type: `application/json`

Provides a summary of the EEG input with the following structure:

- **Subject**     `string`      - name of the subject.
- **Version**     `string`      - the current version of the EEG analysis script.
- **Session**     `string`      - name of the session.
- **Sampling**    `number`      - the sampling rate.
- **Windows**     `number`      - the duration (in seconds) of each segment (epoch) used as the bases of the FFT analysis.
- **Duration**    `number`      - the duration of the data.
- **Blinks**      `number`      - the number of blink artifacts in the data.
- **Meta-Blinks** `number`      - the blinks metadata.
- **CH_mean_BAND_power**  `number`  - the mean power of a certain band in a channel. Default: `c(Delta, Theta, Alpha, Low Beta, High Beta, Gamma)`
- **CH_IAF**      `number`      - the individual alpha frequency in the channel.
- **CH_IAF_power**  `number`    - the power of the individual alpha frequency in the channel.
- **Meta_CH_Samples** Â `number` - the meta-number of samples for the individual alpha frequency in the channel.
- **Meta_CH_LongestQualitySegment** `number`  - the longest quality segment for the duration recorded in the channel.
- **Meta_CH_SpectralQuality** `number`  - the score for spectral quality in the channel.
